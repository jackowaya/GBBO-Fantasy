# GBBO Fantasy League
How to play The Great British Bake Off Fantasy League: draft a team and get points depending on how they perform throughout the season.

## Number Of Players
Best suited for two to four players. With more players you may want to allow each contestant to
be selected by more than one player or make all players drop down to one contestant once a player
has no contestants left..

## Draft
1. Flip a [Hob-nob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobnob_biscuit) to decide who drafts first.
2. Alternate choosing players, make sure to do your reasearch https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/
3. First person you draft is your "captain." All other draftees are equal.
4. Feel free to use [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P__zc4jc638WBl_MPb1T2o05ou97sRpo7Os7VMjWFNc/edit?usp=sharing) to track your team and scores. 
5. For 2 or 3 players, we recommend only drafting 3 contestants each.
6. For 4 or 5 players, we recommend drafting 2 contestants each.
7. For 6 or more players, we recommend making multiple copies of each contestant. Two copies worked well for 6 players.

## Re-Draft
After each elimination, players may swap one of their contestants with an available contestant. The first player who gets the option to do so is the one who had a contestant eliminated. Remaining players may then swap members of their team with available contestants from lowest to highest total score. If two contestants are eliminated, the player with the lowest total score chooses a replacement first.

To balance the team sizes, we recommend forcing teams to drop down to the same size when it is no longer possible for all teams to have the same number of players. For example, if 5 players have 2 contestants each, when enough contestants are eliminated so that there are only 9, all teams would drop down to a single contestant.

After contestants are dropped or sent home, and the players who lost them have an opportunity to pick up new ones, we allow an opportunity for all other teams to swap for the dropped contestants, in order of total points.

## Scoring
Prior to each episode you can choose a new captain for that episode. Feel free to score while watching.

### Signature Challenge

| +1 | 3rd Place |
| +1 | Extra point if captain places in top three. |
| +2 | Handshake from Paul, extra point if handshake occurs during bread week. |
| -2 | Soggy Bottom! |

We do not score confsessional interviews in the Technical Challenge round because we feel it is already worth enough points.

### Showstopper Challenge
| Points | Description |
| --- | --- |
| +2 | Handshake from Paul, extra point if handshake occurs during bread week. |
| +1 | Paul or Prue say "wow" (1 point for each occurance) |
| -2 | Soggy Bottom or Something is Undercooked |
| +1 | Confessional segment for a positive reason after the challenge and before the star baker reveal |
| -1 | Confessional segment for a negative reason after the challenge and before the star baker reveal |
| -4 | Contestant drops or showstopper falls apart when walking to the gingham alter. |

We only count confessional interviews before the star baker reveal because otherwise the star baker would always get 2 extra points, since they get an extra segment at the end..

## Ingredient Scoring
Each week, a player (rotate who) may choose an ingredient to use for ingredient scoring. Any
contestant who uses that ingredient in the signature or showstopper earns one point.
These ingredients are intended to be anything other than staples. Chocolate or raspberry
would be acceptable picks, while butter (which might be used to target against a vegan baker)
or sugar would not.
For scoring, it has to be clear a baker used the ingredient. This is another reason to choose
flavorings - they are almost always mentioned explicitly, whereas even a somewhat uncommon staple
like an unusual sugar may not be.
You can also use this as a catch up method, by having only the player(s) in last place select
the ingredient that will score points that week.
