# GBBO Fantasy League
How to play The Great British Bake Off Fantasy League: draft a team and get points depending on how they perform throughout the season.

## Number Of Players
Best suited for two to four players. With more players you may want to allow each contestant to
be selected by more than one player.

## Draft
1. Flip a [Hob-nob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobnob_biscuit) to decide who drafts first.
2. Alternate choosing players, make sure to do your reasearch https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/
3. First person you draft is your "captain." All other draftees are equal.
4. Feel free to use [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P__zc4jc638WBl_MPb1T2o05ou97sRpo7Os7VMjWFNc/edit?usp=sharing) to track your team and scores. 
5. For 2 or 3 players, we recommend only drafting 3 contestants each, then using redraft rules below.

## Re-Draft
After each elimination, players may swap one of their contestants with an available contestant. The first player who gets the opption to do so is the one who had a contestant eliminated. Remaining players may then swap from lowest to highest total score.

## Scoring
Prior to each episode you can choose a new captain for that episode. Feel free to score during while watching.

### Signature Challenge

We do not score confsessional interviews in the Technical Challenge round because we feel it is already worth enough points.

### Showstopper Challenge

| +1 | Paul or Prue say "wow" (1 point for each occurance) |
| -2 | Soggy Bottom or Something is Undercooked |
| +1 | Confessional segment for a positive reason after the challenge and before the star baker reveal |
| -1 | Confessional segment for a negative reason after the challenge and before the star baker reveal |
| -4 | Contestant drops or showstopper falls apart when walking to the gingham alter. |

We only count confessional interviews before the star baker reveal because otherwise the star baker would always get 2 extra points, since they get an extra segment at the end..

## Ingredient Scoring
Each week, each player may choose an ingredient to use for ingredient scoring. When a
contestant who uses that ingredient in the signature or showstopper earns one point.
These ingredients are intended to be anything other than staples. Chocolate or raspberry
would be acceptable picks, while butter (which might be used to target against a vegan baker)
or sugar would not.
